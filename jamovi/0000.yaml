  A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it allows for
  power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model
  (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA) and other statistical tests.  For
  the GLM can be based on standardized coefficients (regression) or proportion
  of partial variance effect siz (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared, Epsilon-Squared).
  It provides estimation of required sample size, power and minimally-detectable
  effect size, plus plots for sensitivity analysis.

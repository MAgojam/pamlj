  A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it allows for
  power analysis of Pearson correlation and the general linear model
  (Anova/Regression/ANCOVA). The latter can be based on standardized
  coefficients (regression) or proportion of partial variance effect siz
  (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared, Epsilon-Squared). It provides estimation of
  required sample size, power and minimally-detectable effect size, plus plots
  for sensitivity analysis.

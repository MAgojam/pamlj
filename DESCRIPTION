Description:   (beta) A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it allows for
               power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model
               (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA) and other statistical tests.  For
               the GLM can be based on standardized coefficients (regression), proportion
               of partial variance effect sizes (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared, Epsilon-Squared),
               or means and standard deviations.
               It provides estimation of required sample size, power and minimally-detectable
               effect size, plus plots for sensitivity analysis.
               plots for sensitivity analysis.
